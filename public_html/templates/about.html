				<p>Americans love our pets. Yet, in 2008, almost 4 million animals were euthanized in the nation's shelters, including 56% of dogs and 71% of cats. There are many reasons for this, including lack of identification, overcrowding, illness, disposition, injuries or suffering from other issues. In the end, only 25% of animals in shelters are adopted.</p>
				<p>That is where PetRescueABQ can step in. Our app facilitates the communication between shelters and potential owners, giving many of these adorable creatures a real chance at living a full life in a loving, forever home.</p>
					<p>To help protect our nation's cats and dogs:<br>
					Have your pets spayed/neutered.<br>
					Keep current identification on your pets at all times, preferably microchips.<br>
						When taking in a new pet, consider adoption from a local animal shelter.<br></p>
				<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
					<p>We believe that cats and dogs in animal shelters deserve a fighting chance to find a new forever home. We advocate reducing the euthanasia rate at shelters across the nation. PetRescueABQ is our attempt to connect animals in shelters with loving owners that provide the forever home each deserves.</p>
